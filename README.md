Introduction - MIT INVENTOR APP This AI application was built with the purpose of carrying out development practices (AI), which includes editing properties of photographs taken previously or at that moment. This application could be useful for users who are on vacation and want to edit photographs in a fun way and then share with their friends.

Functionality The application uses photographs that can be uploaded from the photo gallery or can be taken at that very moment, these photographs can be edited with lines of different colors and points, text can be added and finally after being edited they can be shared with others users through WhatsApp, email, Telegram, etc.

Logic flow To use this application it is recommended to follow these steps.

Capture the photo (from the camera or from the "Load photo" photo gallery).
Edit the photo with your finger, for which it is possible to use lines (click on random line to choose a random line color) and points
Add text to the photo through the text box and the "Add text to photo" button
Share the edited photograph with other users through the "Share" button
Important notes The application has predefined colors (random) for the editing lines. All tests were performed with a real phone through the MIT AI2 Companion application Below is a detail of the application logic blocks image
